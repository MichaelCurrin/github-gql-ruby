# Github GraphQL Ruby
> Request the Github GraphQL API using Ruby

This repo is very light - it does a POST request using the [Faraday](https://lostisland.github.io/faraday/) gem against the [Github GraphQL API](https://developer.github.com/v4/). This could be adjusted to do GQL requests on other APIs.

For more advanced cases, you can use Ruby gems which are built for GraphQL. They might handle things like schema validation and error handling but I have not used them.

- [github/graphql-client](https://github.com/github/graphql-client) - There is a nice example in their docs using the Star Wars API. Note this gem requires Ruby 2.4.4 or higher.
- [rmosolgo/graphql-ruby](https://github.com/rmosolgo/graphql-ruby)
